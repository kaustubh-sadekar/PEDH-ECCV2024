**Our proposed DeePEDH pipeline enables SPCs to be used in resource-constrained applications.** SPCs generate large amounts of raw timestamp data, requiring high in-pixel memory and causing a data bottleneck. (a-d) Conventional 3D SPCs resort to low-resolution equi-width (EW) histograms resulting in poor distance resolution. (e-g) DeePEDH uses a more efficient on-sensor compression scheme through equi-depth (ED) histograms combined with a deep neural network distance map estimator. (h) The proposed method provides accurate high-resolution distance maps with 10 - 100x lower bandwidth. (i-k) DeePEDH paves the way for various computer vision tasks to be performed on resource-constrained devices using SPCs for 3D sensing.
